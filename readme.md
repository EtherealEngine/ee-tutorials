# Development Repo for Ethereal Engine Tutorials
This is a meta-project for creating EE Tutorial/Example projects.  
It contains:
- Collection of project ideas that could turn into useful tutorials
- Already published tutorials _(as submodules)_
- Source code of Work-in-Progress tutorial projects

## Cloning the Repository
The repository must be cloned with submodule recursion:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git://github.com/EtherealEngine/ee-tutorials.git
```

If you already cloned the repository without recursive submodules
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
